# Heterogeneous_Stacked_Ensemble_Classifier-Super_Learner
The Super Learner is a heterogeneous stacked ensemble classifier. This is a classification model that uses a set of base classifiers of different types, the outputs of which are then combined in another classifier at the stacked layer. The base classifiers are trained and their outputs are combined along with the training dataset labels into a training set for the stack layer classifier. To avoid overfitting the generation of the stacked layer training set uses a k-fold cross validation process. To further add variety to the base estimators a bootstrapping selection is used (as in the bagging ensemble approach).
